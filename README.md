# RFID attendance log using ESP8266

 This project aims to implement a comprehensive system that monitors bus usage by college students and faculty, replaces manual attendance registers in labs and libraries, and restricts unauthorized access to sensitive locations such as server rooms. The system utilizes unique RFID cards assigned to each student and faculty member, which contain essential details such as their name, register number, and a unique identifier (UID). Students and faculty scan their cards at designated RFID scanners to log their attendance or gain authorized access to restricted areas.
